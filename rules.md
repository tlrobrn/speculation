# Speculation

Set up your hand and manipulate the market to out-score your opponents!

## Required to Play

- 2-4 players
- 2 standard decks of cards
- A way to keep score between rounds

## Game Setup

Speculation is played with a 52-card deck made up of eight cards from each of the ranks 2-7, along with four Jokers.

To form the deck, take the 2-7 cards from each suit and two Jokers from each of two standard decks, then combine them to create a single 52-card deck.

(If your decks do not contain two Jokers each, you can substitute a court card as a stand-in.)

## Round Setup

The game consists of 3 rounds. Before each round, set up the play area as follows:

1. Shuffle the deck and place it within reach of the players.
2. Draw the top 3 cards from the deck, placing each face-up to start 3 separate piles next to the deck.

## Gameplay

Players take turns in clockwise order until one player has 10 or more cards in their hand. When that happens, the other players get one more turn, and the round ends.

On your turn, choose 1 of 3 actions:

1. Take the top card from one of the discard piles.
2. Draw 2 cards from the deck; keep one and discard the other face-up on a discard pile of your choice.
3. Discard a card from your hand face-up to a discard pile; if it matches either the number or suit of the top card of one of the other two discard piles, take that whole pile into your hand.

**Jokers** are wild for option 3. If you discard a Joker, you can pick either of the two remaining discard piles to add to your hand. Similarly, you can discard any card to the top of a pile to take a pile with a Joker on top.

Once you've taken your action, if any of the three discard piles is empty, flip over the top card of the deck and place it in that pile. Your turn is then over, and the next player takes their turn.

## Scoring

At the end of each round, players score based on the top card of certain discard piles (depending on the round) and the cards in their hand.

- **Round 1**: Score based on the top card of the first discard pile (the one closest to the deck). Each player scores the value of that card for every card of the same suit they have in their hand.
  
  Example: If the top card of the first discard pile is the **4 of Spades**, and Susan has 6 Spades, Tony has 5 Spades, and Michael has 3 Spades, their scores would be:
  - Susan: **24 points** (4 x 6)
  - Tony: **20 points** (4 x 5)
  - Michael: **12 points** (4 x 3)

- **Round 2**: Score based on both the first and second discard piles.
- **Round 3**: Score based on all three discard piles.

_Jokers in hand do not count toward any suit when scoring. If a Joker is on top of a scoring pile, then each player scores 1 point per card in any suit of their choosing._

## Winning

If at the end of **any** round a player has all 4 Jokers in their hand, they win immediately!

Otherwise, after the third round, the player with the most points accumulated across all rounds is the winner.
