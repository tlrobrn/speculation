# Speculation

Try to setup your hand to score big in the end!

## Required to play

- 2-4 players
- 2 standard decks of cards
- A way to keep score between rounds

## Game setup

Speculation is played with a 52 card deck made up cards 2-7 and Jokers. In order to build the deck you will need two standard decks each with two Jokers (or use court cards to stand in for Jokers).

### Form the deck

To form the deck, take the 2-7 from each suit and two Jokers from each deck and combine them to make one 52 card deck.

## Round setup

The game consists of 3 rounds, before each round setup the play area as follows:

1. Shuffle the deck and set it within reach of both players.
2. Draw the top 3 cards from the deck placing each face up to start 3 separate piles next to the deck.

## Game play

Players alternate taking turns until one player has 10 or more cards in their hand. Once that happens, the other player gets one more turn and the round ends.

On your turn you choose 1 of 3 actions to take:

1. Take a card from the top of one of the discard piles.
2. Draw 2 cards from the deck; take one and discard the other face up on a discard pile of your choice.
3. Discard a card from your hand face up to a discard pile; if it matches either the number or the suit of the top card of one of the other 2 discard piles, take that whole pile into your hand.

Jokers count as wild for option 3. In other words, if you discard a Joker you can pick either of the two remaining discard piles to add to your hand. Likewise, you may discard any card to the top of a pile to take a pile that has a Joker on top.

## Scoring

You score based on the top card from certain discard piles (depending on the round) and the cards in your hand.

For the first round, you look at the card on top of the first discard pile. Each player then scores the value of that card for every card of that suit they have in their hand.

For example, if the top card of the first discard pile was the **4 of Spades**, and Susan had 6 Spades, Tony had 5 Spades, and Michael had 3 Spades, then Susan would score **24 points** _(4 * 6)_, Tony would score **20 points** _(4 * 5)_, and Michael would score **12 points** _(4 * 3)_.

For the second round you do the same, but do so for both the first and second discard pile.
For the third round you do the same scoring all the discard piles.

_Jokers do not count towards suit majority when scoring._

## Winning

If at the end of **any** round a player has all 4 Jokers in their hand, they win immediately!

Barring victory by Jokers, after the third round whoever has accumulated the most total points across each round is the winner!
